## Setup
- All data is stored in an array on the server.
- Running the server code requires nodemon. If you don't already have nodemon, install it globally with npm install nodemon --global.
- npm install npm run server
- Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with cmd + t and start the react client app.
- npm run client
- Between the server and client, you'll need two terminal tabs! Because we're using nodemon, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made!
